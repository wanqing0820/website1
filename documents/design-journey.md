## Sticky Form Planning (Milestone 2)

### Sticky Form (Milestone 2)
> What controls do you need for your form?
The form will be filtering input that contains html special characters so the users won''t be able to key in bad input.

> Plan out your feedback messages for your form. You may sketch (probably the easiest) or write it out.
The feedback messages will be notifying the users whichever form that's not filled by saying (form name) is required'.


> How does this form meet the needs of at least one of your target audiences (specify which)?
This form meets the needs of both target audience to create an account in the system.


### Validation Code Plan (Milestone 2)
> Write out your pseudocode plan for handling the validation of the form.

```
read the input from post, filter accordingly, save the input in variables and then output values with html special characters removed.
```

## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Target Audiences (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the target audiences. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable by both target audiences.
In the final site, the contents are arranged according to the results of card sorting and meant to put both target audience's needs into the same pages and so the general information is placed on the home page. Both target audience, users and photographers will be able to read the information about the website and decide if they like the site. If they do, they will then navigate to the sign up/Policy/ Gallery page for further information. The gallery page is meant to satisfy the needs of the target audience, users to look for phone wallpapers. The policy page is meant for both target audience, and users' portion is above photographers' as users are expected to constitute a larger percentage among the target audience. Also, the sign up page is for both target audience to create their accounts.


### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.
Labels for each form is removed to reduce clutter on the sign up page. Names of forms are placed in the form instead. Also, the upload portal could not be implemented at this point as it belongs to later part of the course.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from 1300? What things did you have trouble with?
I have learned to filter and validate input (server-side validation), make the forms sticky, and prevent any potential dangerous input from users for phishing. I had trouble with programmatically show the user the current page they are on, as the styling for that is overwritten elsewhere in main.css. It took some time to debug and I had to opt for !important in the end.
